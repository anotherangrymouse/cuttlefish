cuttlefish is just a small web app that leverages ebay's Kraken.js. Kraken.js and all that magic is of course, under their license here: 
https://github.com/krakenjs/kraken-js/blob/v0.7.x/LICENSE.txt

cuttlefish is the CSS, HTML and routes that I have built on top of Kraken.js. Not the underlying framework itself. Eventually this will
be significant as this application matures into an application that can be used as a starting point to build simple but scalable websites
that have a content management API, contact form and easy front-end development.
